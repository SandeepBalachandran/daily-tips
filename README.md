* Jasmine
  * Jasmine is an open source behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for testing JavaScript code.
  * Jasmine does not have dependencies on any JavaScript framework, and it does not need a Document Object Model (DOM)
  * A Jasmine test suite starts by calling the global describe function that takes two distinct parameters 
      * String -  is where you give a name for the suite, describing what you are testing.
      * Function - this parameter executes the tests (also called specs).
